  <h1>Tfl & the London Transport Museum</h1>
  <h2>A 5 day sprint to find ways of attracting visitors and new Londoners
    to Santander Cycles</h2>
  <p><strong>My role: </strong>UX Designer in a multi-disciplinary design team</p>

  <h2>Mapping user journeys and pinpointing problems</h2>
    <p>The team began by understanding the Santander Cycle Hire scheme from
      business and user perspectives. After gaining insights from TfL and
      interviewing the general public, we mapped the user's journey through the
      service, including common pain points at each stage.</p>

  <h2>Mapping user journeys and pinpointing problems</h2>
    <p>My initial concept had two key parts. The first was a dedicated Cycle
      Hire Ambassador located at selected docking stations, who would assist
      new users and give pre-booked safety inductions in the form of a short
      ride around the local area.</p>
    <p>The second was an add-on to the Cycle Hire mobile app, which suggested
      interesting routes near each docking station. These could be viewed by
      difficulty and/or subject (e.g. museums, architecture, parks).</p>

    <h2>User generated content</h2>
      <p>After testing various prototypes with the public and receiving
        feedback from the TfL experience team, the sprint team developed the
        idea of user generated cycle routes. How can we build on the natural
        tendency of users to share experiences online? Can shares on social
        media be used to suggest new routes? Is social media a more attractive
        entry point to the app? It was important to not only design the new
        feature but also how users will discover and return to it.</p>

​      <p>The full concept was presented to the wider TfL team at the end of the
        sprint, suggesting new avenues for innovation of the app and wider Cycle Hire
        scheme.</p>
