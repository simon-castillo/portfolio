        <p>These service maps were created to give a wider view of the user journey and government touchpoints involved in right to work checks. They are grounded in user research, and allow the project team to find areas of the service to improve.</p>
        <p>They are also a useful tool for communicating internally to stakeholders.</p>

      <h2 class="multi-project-page">Cleaning up imported text</h2>

      <table class="project-info">
        <tr>
          <td><h3>Project</h3></td>
          <td><p>An internal reporting platform</p></td>

          <td><p>Design a way for users to sanitise reports that have been imported automatically from another reporting system.</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

        <p>In user research sessions, we noticed that people’s existing method for cleaning up imported text was to paste the content into Word, then edit and paste back into the platform afterwards.</p>
        <p>We wanted to let them sanitise the report more efficiently, in one screen.</p>
        <p>So, at the end of the import flow, when the user lands on the editable report, I added a sidebar that maintains the original data - uneditable - for reference. The user can open this, compare directly to their new report and add or remove data as needed.</p>

            <td><p>Design dashboards for viewing platform usage metrics.</p></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

          <p>The task here was to iterate on existing, ‘blue-sky’ dashboard designs that had not yet been built, and update them to display the latest available dataset.</p>
          <p>Grouping and hierarchy were especially important. The user needs to perceive and understand the information at a glance, so text was kept to a minimum and data was visualised wherever possible.</p>

          <tr>
            <td><h3><strong>Brief</strong></p></td>
            <td><p>To let users know the status of their reports, confirm when their actions are successful, and notify them about important system changes.</p></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

          <p>As statuses and notifications are a common design challenge, I began with secondary research, focusing on common layouts, transitions and best practice.</p>
          <p>It was important that all of the alerts were highly useful and unobtrusive, otherwise users might learn to ignore them, so the solution used as little ‘design’ as possible. Metadata was removed, background colour was chosen to be noticeable but not distracting and language was kept concise.</p>
