      <h2>Status and notifications</h2>

        <h3>Brief</h3>

          <p>Design:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>a way for users to know the status of their intelligence reports</li>
            <li>how users will be made aware of important changes</li>
            <li>confirmations that something has successfully been changed after a user action</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>The main challenge here was to give a report’s status the correct visual importance on the page, while freeing up space in the header.</p>
            <p>Users also needed to know all the possible report statuses (draft, uncomplied, complied) to better understand where they are in the report-writing process.</p>
            <p>For this, the designers took a mobile first approach. I began by gathering secondary research on mobile notifications, with a focus on common layouts, transitions and best practice as suggested by top design teams outside government.</p>
            <p>It is important that notifications are useful and unobtrusive, otherwise users might learn to ignore them. So, the solution used as little ‘design’ as possible. We excluded metadata as notifications usually appear as a direct result of a user action. Background colour was chosen to be noticeable but not distracting, and content was kept concise.</p>

      <h2>Management information</h2>

        <h3>Brief</h3>

          <p>Design dashboards for users to view various SIP usage metrics.</p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>

          <p>My task here was to iterate on existing, ‘blue-sky’ dashboard designs that had not yet been built, and update them to display the data that was needed.</p>
          <p>I shared initial designs with the wider team and edited the mock-ups based on input from designers, developers, business analysts and the product manager, going through multiple versions before passing to development.</p>

        <h3>The Design</h3>

          <p>Grouping and hierarchy are especially important when designing dashboards, which need to be read at a glance.</p>
          <p>Text was kept to a minimum and data was visualised wherever possible. Coloured arrows were used to indicate percentage changes. Numbers were sized to reflect their importance and line graphs were used to show fluctuations over time.</p>
